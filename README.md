Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.

## Early Signs of Diabetes

Hunger and fatigue. Your body converts the food you eat into glucose that your cells use for energy*

Peeing more often and being thirstier

Dry mouth and itchy skin

Blurred vision
